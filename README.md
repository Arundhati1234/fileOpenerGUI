# fileOpenerGUI
Using this small program, the user can open up all the starter files together, instead of opening them one at a time.

Every time a programmer starts their computer, they may need to open up a variety of apps to get started with their work day. Taking my own 
case, as soon as I open up my pc, I need spotify, teams and vscode to start off. Saving those few minutes, once you enter these file locations 
into this GUI, it saves them into a text file. So next time onwards, when you start your computer again, all you need to do is click on the 
'Run Apps' button on the GUI and it will open up all the applications for you. If need be, you can modify your preferences anytime using the 
'Delete List' button. Can save your valuable time if you need to open up the same set of apps all the time.
